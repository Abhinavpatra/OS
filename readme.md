Creating an OS self
1. do `npm outdated` and/or `npm update` every time you update the project
2. red up next-pwa
3. Jest checking
   1. npm install -D jest jest-environment-jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/dom @testing-library/jest-dom ts-node @types/jest
   2. npm init jest@latest
4. `processDirectory`: You can use processDirectory.HelloWorld.Component to render the HelloWorld app/component dynamically in your UI, such as in a window manager or app launcher. This pattern is common in desktop-like web apps to manage and load apps on demand.
